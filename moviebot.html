                <p class="introPara">I love watching movies. I have watched most of the IMDb top 250 and many of the popular ones so it becomes really hard to find a new movie to watch. I hate to waste my time on an uninteresing movie and also despise trying to search for a good movie to watch so I thought of making something that would solve the problem. Well, a couple of months ago, Facebook released the messenger platform and I thougt it was really cool that we could just communicate with a bot. I thought I would give this interface a try. </p>

                        I began with the basics. Making a Facebook page, setting up webhooks, etc by simply following the documentation. Now I had a functioning but useless bot that returned back whatever was sent. That's it! I apparently started this on June 20th, 2016.

                         Having had no prior experience in JavaScript it all came down to figuring out how things actually worked. I started working with the documentation and tried to sent hard-coded image links and templates to make sure I actually knew how it was working. 
                         After trying, testing and reading, I finally figured out how to use all the basic tricks to send messages and templates. Now I had to actually have it send movie information using TMDb API. That took me a few days because I had never used an API before this. After a lot of trial and error I suddenly had a movie name that wasn't hardcoded, sent from the bot.
